WebSocket:

- A protocol that enables bidirectional, real-time communication between a web browser and a server
- Allows for efficient, low-latency communication
- Enables scenarios like live updates, live notifications, and interactive applications

- Uses TCP/IP as the underlying transport protocol
-its also a common protocol like http,smtp

so first of all you have to install express and

Here is the full process to establish a WebSocket connection using (link unavailable)

Server-side (Node.js)

1. Install  using npm: npm install 
2. Create a new Node.js server using Express.js or any other framework
3. Require  and initialize it with the server instance: const io = require('(link unavailable)')(server)
4. Define a namespace or a room for the WebSocket connection (optional): const namespace = io.of('/my-namespace')
5. Listen for connections and handle them using the connection event: namespace.on('connection', (socket) => { ... })
6. Handle messages from clients using the socket.on method: socket.on('message', (message) => { ... })
7. Broadcast messages to all clients using the socket.emit method: socket.emit('message', 'Hello from server!')

Client-side (Browser or Node.js)

1. Include the (link unavailable) client library in your HTML file: <script src="/(link unavailable)/(link unavailable).js"></script>
2. Establish a connection to the server using the io function: const socket = io('http://localhost:3000/my-namespace')
3. Handle messages from the server using the socket.on method: socket.on('message', (message) => { ... })
4. Send messages to the server using the socket.emit method: socket.emit('message', 'Hello from client!')

Here is the theoretical explanation of establishing a WebSocket connection using 

Server-side:

1. Initialization: Initialize  on the server-side by requiring the  module and passing the server instance to it.
2. Namespace: Define a namespace or room for the WebSocket connection (optional).
3. Connection: Listen for incoming connections using the connection event.
4. Message Handling: Handle messages from clients using the socket.on method.
5. Broadcasting: Broadcast messages to all clients using the socket.emit method.

Client-side:

1. Library Inclusion: Include the  client library in the HTML file.
2. Connection: Establish a connection to the server using the io function.
3. Message Handling: Handle messages from the server using the socket.on method.
4. Message Sending: Send messages to the server using the socket.emit method.

Key Concepts:

- WebSocket: A bi-directional, real-time communication protocol.
-socket.io: A library that enables WebSocket connections and provides additional features.
- Namespace: A way to organize and separate WebSocket connections.
- Connection: The establishment of a WebSocket connection between client and server.
- Message Handling: The process of receiving and sending messages between client and server.
